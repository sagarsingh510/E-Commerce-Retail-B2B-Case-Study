## Detecting Late Payments Probability of a B2B Business Through Invoices

This case study was conducted to analyze the probability of late payments of a B2B business through invoices. 
The analysis was done on Jupyter Notebook.

## **Objective**
The main objective of this case study was to analyze the payment behavior of a B2B business and to predict the probability of late payments through invoices.

## **Data**
The data used in this case study was obtained from the company's billing system. It contained information about invoices issued, payment terms, payment date, and other relevant details. The dataset was preprocessed before conducting the analysis.

## **Methodology**
**The following methodology was used to conduct the analysis:**

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data and identify any outliers or missing values.

 2. Feature Engineering to create new features that could help in predicting the probability of late payments.

 3. Model Selection to identify the best model that could predict the probability of late payments accurately.

 4. Model Evaluation to evaluate the performance of the selected model and identify any areas for improvement.
