## Problem Statement

**Schuster** is a multinational retail company dealing in sports goods and accessories. Schuster conducts significant business with hundreds of its vendors, with whom it has credit arrangements. Unfortunately, not all vendors respect credit terms and some of them tend to make payments late. Schuster levies heavy late payment fees, although this procedure is not beneficial to either party in a long-term business relationship. The company has some employees who keep chasing vendors to get the payment on time; this procedure nevertheless also results in non-value-added activities, loss of time and financial impact. Schuster would thus try to understand its customers’ payment behaviour and predict the likelihood of late payments against open invoices.

To understand how to approach this problem using data science, let’s first understand the payment process at Schuster now. Every time a transaction of goods takes place with a vendor, the accounting team raises an invoice and shares it with the vendor. This invoice contains the details of the goods, the invoice value, the creation date and the payment due date based on the credit terms as per the contract. Business with these vendors occurs quite frequently. Hence, there are always multiple invoices associated with each vendor at any given time.

## Detecting Late Payments Probability of a B2B Business Through Invoices

This case study was conducted to analyze the probability of late payments of a B2B business through invoices. 
The analysis was done on Jupyter Notebook.

## **Objective**
The main objective of this case study was to analyze the payment behavior of a B2B business and to predict the probability of late payments through invoices.

## **Data**
The data used in this case study was obtained from the company's billing system. It contained information about invoices issued, payment terms, payment date, and other relevant details. The dataset was preprocessed before conducting the analysis.

## **Methodology**
**The following methodology was used to conduct the analysis:**

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data and identify any outliers or missing values.

 2. Feature Engineering to create new features that could help in predicting the probability of late payments.

 3. Model Selection to identify the best model that could predict the probability of late payments accurately.

 4. Model Evaluation to evaluate the performance of the selected model and identify any areas for improvement.
